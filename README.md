## Contributing

We'd really like if you can take some time to make sure your coding style is
consistent with the project. Uguu follows [PHP
PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
coding style guides. We use PHPCS tools to enforce these standards.

You can also help by sending us feature requests or writing documentation and
tests.
